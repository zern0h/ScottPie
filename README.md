Introduction
The Scott's Pi Calculation Web App is a powerful tool designed to compute Scott's Pi value. This documentation provides a comprehensive guide on how to use the web app, explaining its functionalities and providing step-by-step instructions for usage.

Overview
The web app utilizes PHP, JavaScript, MathJax, HTML, and CSS to provide an intuitive user interface and accurate calculation of Scott's Pi. Scott's Pi, also known as Scott's Ï€ or Scott's Percentage Agreement is a statistic developed by William A. Scott that assesses the degree of agreement among multiple raters when coding or categorizing data into nominal categories.

Functionality
1. Input: The web app allows users to input data sets that require Scott's Pi calculation. Users can enter the data sets directly into the provided input field or upload a Microsoft Excel file.

2. Calculation: Once the data is provided, the web app employs an algorithm to calculate Scott's Pi value. The algorithm analyzes the agreement among multiple raters by comparing their categorization of the data sets.

3. Result Display: The calculated Scott's Pi value is displayed to the user, along with the computed table from the data input. The result is presented in a clear and understandable format.

Usage Instructions

1. Accessing the Web App: Users can access Scott's Pi Calculation Web App by navigating to the provided URL. The app is compatible with modern web browsers and accessible across different devices.

2. Data Input: Users can manually input the data sets into the designated field or upload a file containing the data. Clear instructions are provided on the web app's interface to guide users through this process.

3. Initiating the Calculation: Once the data is entered or uploaded, users can initiate the calculation process by clicking the "Calculate". The web app validates the data and proceeds with the computation.

4. Result Presentation: The calculated Scott's Pi value is presented on the web app's interface. Users can view the result, including the tabular computation. The web app ensures that the result is displayed in a user-friendly and easily understandable format. The table can be downloaded to an Excel File Format for offline usage.

5. Iterative Usage: Users can perform multiple calculations using different data sets by repeating the data input and calculation steps outlined above. The web app allows for a seamless and iterative workflow, enabling users to easily analyze various data sets.

Development Procedure

1. Requirements Gathering: A standard software development process typically begins with gathering requirements. This involves understanding the needs of the users and stakeholders, defining the functionalities and features required, and documenting these requirements. For this web app, the requirements include the ability to input data sets, perform Scott's Pi calculation, and display the results.

2. Design and Architecture: Following the requirements gathering phase, a software architecture and design plan was created. This includes defining the overall structure of the application, selecting appropriate technologies and frameworks, and designing the user interface. This web app utilizes HTML, CSS (including Bootstrap CSS framework), and MathJax for client-side (front-end) and PHP and JavaScript for the server-side (backend) as shown below:

3. Development and Testing: The development phase involves implementing the designed architecture, coding the functionalities, and conducting testing to ensure the app behaves as intended. Development included building the input form and the file upload functionality, implementing the algorithm for Scott's Pi calculation, and creating the result display with a download functionality for the table. Testing involved verifying the accuracy of calculations, handling different scenarios, and checking for any bugs or issues.

Conclusion
The Scott's Pi Calculation Web App is a powerful tool that simplifies the computation of Scott's Pi value. Its intuitive user interface and accurate calculations provide users with a comprehensive solution for assessing agreement among multiple raters. By following the usage instructions outlined in this documentation, users can effectively utilize the web app to analyze their data sets and gain valuable insights.
